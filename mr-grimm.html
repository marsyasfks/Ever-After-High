            <h1>Headmaster Grimm</h1>
            <p><b>Milton Grimm</b> is a centuries-old being who's traveled many places before he founded Ever After High in 1812. These days he serves as the school's headmaster. He treats the students with a favorable destiny better than the ones without, but nonetheless insists that everyone follows the destiny as dictated by their story, even going as far as letting a case like the Evil Queen's theft and replacement of the real Storybook of Legends go unscathed for the sake of students following their destiny.
                Headmaster Grimm is the brother of Giles Grimm, and son of Mr. Grimm. The Brothers disagreed about the importance of following one's story, and Milton cast a babble spell on Giles, estranging the two. The spell was recently lifted by Apple White, Raven Queen, and their friends during the Thronecoming celebration. Since then, the brothers have reconciled.
