            <p>Ever After High is a boarding school located in the Fairy Tale World. It is attended by the teenage children of fairy tale characters. The main characters are Raven Queen, who does not want to be evil like her mother the Evil Queen, and Apple White, the daughter of Snow White who wishes to live "happily ever after". Raven prefers to be free to create her own destiny, while Apple, to protect her and others' own destiny, believes that Raven should become the next Evil Queen. The students are generally divided into two groups. The "Royals" are the students who side with Apple in embracing their destinies and following in their parents' footsteps. The "Rebels" are the students who side with Raven in wanting to create their own destinies. Many of the stories are about the students' regular interactions as teens, but there is an underlying story arc where, according to the school's headmaster, if the students do not follow their individual destinies, their stories will cease to exist and they will disappear forever.</p>
