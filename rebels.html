        <h1>Rebels History!</h1>
        <section class="about-reb">
        <h4>The Rebels of Ever After High are the future fairytale characters who believe the people of their world should be free to choose their own paths in life. The Rebel crowd consists of both people with a future that doesn't fit their identity, people who don't agree with role predetermination, and clearly people who have destinies that would make them criminals and get some of them such as Ramona killed if they went through with it. The Rebels oppose the Royals, who want their destinies to take their courses undisturbed, regardless of the cost others have to pay for it.

            The symbol of the Rebels is a golden heart with wings which is actually fitting because Rebels follow their heart and since the wings symbolize freedom the Rebels are free to write their destiny whenever they want to.
            Students who side with and support the Rebels think it is unfair that students are forced to follow a pre-written path and instead wish to write their own stories and follow their hearts. The leader of the Rebels is Raven Queen, the daughter of the infamous Evil Queen. As the kind and caring daughter of one of Ever After's most feared villains, Raven decided she didn't want her mother's life as her own and openly questioned The System of Legacies. Not all Rebels dislike their destinies, some choose only to change their stories slightly while others join the Rebel cause to support their friends.</h4>
