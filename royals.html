        <h1>Royal History!</h1>
        <section class="about-ro">
        <h4>The Royals of Ever After High are the future fairytale characters who stand for adherence to tradition and piety to destiny. Not too surprisingly, most of them have a pleasant future laid out for them. Nearly all of them are royalty and most have a Happily Ever After ahead. The Royals oppose the Rebels, who seek to break open the system and inject choice, regardless of the consequences this may have for those who do want their destiny and are dependent on others adhering to theirs to get it. Some of the Royals hold a grudge against the Rebels, after they didn't willingly sign during Legacy Day.

            On the other hand; some Royals feel like disowning their destinies, facing huge and serious debts, problems, issues with their stories like Briar Beauty and Ashlynn Ella. According to Briar, she doesn't want to follow her destiny by sleeping for 100 years, while Ashlynn's side is questionable since she has a boyfriend named, Hunter Huntsman who is a Rebel. Duchess Swan is destined to be a tragic heroine which is a problem in her destiny, as a result she lacks her Happily Ever After like most princesses have, she tries to change her fate with other princesses, but so far she hasn't yet. Lizzie Hearts, also doesn't like some parts of her destiny like shouting and yelling a lot since it ruins her voice and hurts her throat. Blondie Lockes, is also too scared to tell some of the people in the Royal crowd that her family isn't distantly Royal and her roots are too far from Royalty.</h4>
