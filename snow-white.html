            <h1>Biggest Donor</h1>
            <p><b>Snow White</b> is the heroine from her generation's "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" and the mother of Apple White. Snow White was also a student at Ever After High, and she greatly supported the idea of following tradition. She is currently an entrepreneur and Royal executive, titled the Fairest of Them All and the Queen of the Land and hero of the Fairytale World. She is revealed to be the ruler of the Fairytale World with her husband. She is portrayed by Cindy Robinson.
                Snow White is considered the most beautiful woman in the land, with pale white skin, plump lips that are red like blood, and dark hair with some areas graying due to age. With pronounced cheekbones and a natural beauty, her eyes are dark blue and her long flowing hair reaches down to her hips, with bangs that part to each side of her face. She dresses her tall and slim body in requited simple fashions, mostly in shades of white, red, and gold.
